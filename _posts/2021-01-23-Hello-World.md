The first post. just testing :)

I used this [link](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to create this little blog. It was helpful.

And if you want to use [disqus](https://disqus.com) the doc on their site is good and you can look at [here](https://poanchen.github.io/blog/2017/07/27/how-to-add-disqus-to-your-jekyll-site) too.

In he post file you should add `comments: true` and in disqus.html you should paste the code from disqus website. You can look at my [repository](https://github.com/Hassan1247/Hassan1247.github.io) for better understanding.
